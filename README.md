This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a page for space nerds. It utlizes publically available API's from NASA's website. 

I did not store these API's as environment variables. Should be pretty easy to build.

Use npm install && npm start, open up a dev server and check it out. :)
